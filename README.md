# checkout_scraper


In the checkout_scraper project, I built the entire journey of a website, starting from opening the website to purchasing a product from the Bestsellers section.

If an error occurs at any step during the process, the error is logged into a Google Sheet.
If the order is successfully placed, the order ID and timestamp are added to the same Google Sheet. Additionally, an email notification is sent in both casesâ€”whether the order fails or succeeds.
